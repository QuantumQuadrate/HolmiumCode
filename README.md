# HolmiumCode

This repo contains all the Python code which has had a nontrivial amount of use for purposes mostly specific to the Holmium experiment.  The root file structure is not configured as a proper git repo as the primary purpose of this repository is to have all the code in one place under the lab group's Github organization, instead of *only* under personal Github accounts.

### microwave-dressing-master

Code used for calculations on the effect of microwave fields on the ground Zeeman states, using a method from Floquet Theory to perform the calculation.

### sat-abs-holmium-master

Code used for analysis of the narrow-line spectroscopy done on the 412 nm line.  Raw data files not included due to file size limitations.

### slower-beam-simulation-main

Code used for simulating the effect of the slowing beam on hot atoms coming from the effusion cell at temperatures in excess of 1100 C.
