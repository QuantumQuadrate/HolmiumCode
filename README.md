# HolmiumCode

This repo contains all the Python code which has had a nontrivial amount of use for purposes mostly specific to the Holmium experiment.  The root file structure is not configured as a proper git repo as the primary purpose of this repository is to have all the code in one place under the lab group's Github organization, instead of *only* under personal Github accounts.
